# Sales-Insight-Project-using-Power-BI
## Overview
This project presents a dynamic and interactive analysis of sales and profit data using Power BI. The data spans from June 2017 to June 2020, providing key insights into revenue, sales quantities, profit margins, and market performance across different regions.

## Data Preparation
The initial dataset was a SQL file. I loaded the data into SQL Workbench to explore and validate the data structure. The data was then imported into Power BI, where I utilized Power Query to clean, transform, and prepare the data for visualization.

## Dashboards

## Key Insights
### Dominance of Delhi NCR:
Delhi NCR consistently outperformed other regions in revenue and sales quantities throughout the analyzed period.
### Revenue Decline in 2020: 
The significant drop in revenue in the first half of 2020 may point to external factors affecting the market.
### Customer Concentration:
A small number of key customers contribute a large portion of the revenue, highlighting the importance of these relationships.

## Conclusion
The dynamic dashboards created offer a comprehensive overview of the company's performance, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making. The use of Power BI and Power Query enabled the creation of interactive visualizations that highlight key trends and areas for improvement.
